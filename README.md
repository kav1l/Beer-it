In mind project to create app where you can easily look for people to have fun with, drink some liquid stuff and meet new people.

Prototype (1):

Tinder looking app, working like dating app, with choosing where you would like to meet up.
Most problems would be with idea, where it would work like dating app and not place to meet new persons.

Protoype (2) (in progress):

App with map, that can show intrested people, in your area of intrest, places in places they mainly like to spend time or have fun.
Friendly user looks, fast and easy way to show yourself on the map for others.
Every person would have circle of intrest they have, and thanks to it program would easly connect intrest to show people with similar "taste".
Additional way, to look for persons would be "dating fun" what shows that you would like to become something more than just friends.
Meet ups would be up to 6 persons as default, after which, you could add one of the "teammates" to friends group.
Group of friends have priority, and shows immediately after logging in on the map is anyone is interested.
you could create private meet ups with 20+ people in group.
Later on we could add the reservation option in choosed restaurants so you wouldnt have to worry about place or staying in line.
